about washing_machine.v 
In this code, the washing machine has four states: IDLE, WASHING_DETERGENT, WASHING_WATER, and DRYING. The start signal triggers the start of the washing machine. The water, detergent, and door signals control the respective outputs. The timer register keeps track of the elapsed time in minutes.

The code uses a finite-state machine (FSM) to transition between the different states based on the elapsed time. Each state sets the appropriate control signals and checks if the required time has passed to transition to the next state.

Please note that this is a simplified example and does not include clock signals or testbench code. You may need to adapt it to your specific requirements and incorporate additional logic as necessary.

about test_bench
In this testbench code, we have an instance of the WashingMachine module, named dut, that we want to test. We generate a clock signal (CLK) with a 10ns period using an always block. The start signal is initially set to 0, and after a delay of 10ns, we set it to 1 to trigger the start of the washing machine. After 2us, we set the start signal back to 0 to stop the washing machine. Finally, we wait for 1us and end the simulation using $finish.

The always @(posedge clk) block is used to clock the dut module and ensures that the simulation advances based on the clock signal.
